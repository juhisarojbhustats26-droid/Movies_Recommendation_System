# Movies_Recommendation_System
This project builds a Movie Recommendation System using the TMDB 5000 Movies dataset from Kaggle. After data preparation and feature construction, cosine similarity is computed to measure movie similarity. A recommendation function suggests the top 5 similar movies for a given input title.
